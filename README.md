# Interactive bouncing 3D wall pattern

Interactive bouncing 3D wall pattern that is activated while people walk by it.


## Summary

My ultimate goal of this pattern is to make it responsive with the environment, especially with people passing by. In short, it can transform, shrink vertically if people passing by or move in front of the pattern. One potential of this design is to create a wall that can breath based on the change of the environment.

## Component Parts

plastic 
arcrylic joints
stepper motor (OUTPUT)
battery
motor shield
distance senser (INPUT)

## Challenges
1. make the structure movable
2. make the joints strong enough without breaking
3. connect motors to strings and make the string actually pulls the installation
>Insight: Making real physical model instead of foam board prototype adds a lot of extra work. Making model that have movement or allow certain movement also doubles the work. Working with electronic need to also deal with materials, designing the components, and physical problems beside coding to make the motors work.


## Timeline

- Week 1: Write proposal, design the structure
- Week 2: Make adjustment to the model to make it movable
- Week 3: Coding, connect stepper motor to the model, make ajustments to the structure and the codes
- Week 4: Adding distance senser 
- Week 5: Present!
